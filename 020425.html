        "the love of your life isnt on hinge<br>
        the love of your life is on twitter"<br>
        the love of your life is sitting three seats<br>
        down from your best friends sin a crowded movie theater<br>
        as you come back from taking a piss<br>
        after three months of blowing her off <br>
        after dancing in a different crowded room and two to three perfect dates <br>
        and all you can do is look at her and say I made the wrong decision
<br>

For my ex girlfriend Lola Kennedy. The night that I met you
I walked into the bar starred you down and imediately knew. I ran home that night alive
after sneaking back into the Sinclair just to say bye a second time. This is a good thing. 
When you come back, I'll still be here, just call me.
