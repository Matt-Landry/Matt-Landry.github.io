I now understand Thomas <br>

There isnt really a good word for a compulsive doubter<br>
<br>
The feeling of being caught seven feet under water not sure which way is up <br>
The feeling of being caught in a monday night open mic not sure if the speaker has actually felt hungry, <br>
    then feeling unsure if you have ever actually felt hungry <br>
<br>
"My body is a garden!" <br>
"My body is a temple!" <br>
"My body is a hand grenade" <br>
<br>
They should really tell kids most cliches are there for a reason
