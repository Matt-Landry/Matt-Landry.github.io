This is my first note on my website. 
I have realized that I have ranted for 
a long time constantly
about people owning things themselves
and how we should all take more creative
control of our lives and what we do. 
I will no longer be a hypocrite and i will
actually do things with this site.
<br>
I was up in Maine the last few days staying
on the coast with my girlfriend Lola.
We drove back this morning and stopped at 
what my friends and I have begun to refer to
as a "dumb store". A dumb store is any store
that you walk into and you imediately feel
that an $18 pair of blue squiggly candles
fits the bill. They are owned
and operated almost in entirely by milenials
who probably still enjoy saying "I mustache you
a question" (honestly I do too).
I love these stores. I got a butter 
holder and a new wine opener for cheap
because its the off season.
<br>
We walked around doing nothing, went to the same
restaurant twice since nothing was open,
and watched Silver Linings Playbook.
It was a great weekend.

<b>EDIT:</b> Alright we broke up but I think these pictures
are lovely so i'll keep them around. What're you gonna do.
She is a sweet girl
