Give me back my tiny sunglasses
And my time
I cant sing this my hearts not in it

it is what it is
call me tomorrow things will be different
it is what it is
call me tomorrow things will be different
it is what it is
call me tomorrow things will be different
it is what it is
call me tomorrow things will be different
They have to be
