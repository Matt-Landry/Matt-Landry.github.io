        "the love of your life isnt on hinge<br>
        the love of your life is on twitter"<br>
        the love of your life is sitting three seats<br>
        down from your best friends in a crowded movie theater<br>
        as you come back from taking a piss<br>
        after three months of blowing her off <br>
        after dancing in a different crowded room and two to three perfect dates <br>
        and all you can do is look at her and say I made the wrong decision
<br>

Wrote this for an ex girlfriend, so sadly it has to go. <br>
Keeping up the picture because I still find it sweet

<!--For my ex girlfriend Lola Kennedy. The night that I met you
I walked into the bar starred you down and imediately knew. I ran home that night alive
after sneaking back into the Sinclair just to say bye a second time. This is a good thing. 
I say so many stupid things, all I want is to be worked and pass out at your feet.
When you come back, I'll still be here, just call me one day and tell me to come home, please.
