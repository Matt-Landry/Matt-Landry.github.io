This is my first note on my website. 
I have realized that I rant for 
a long time all the time
about people owning things themselves
and how we should all take more creative
control of things in our lives. 

I will no longer be a hypocrite and i will
actually do things with this more often.

I was up in Maine the last few days staying
on the coast with my girlfriend Lola.
We drove back this morning and stopped at 
what my friends and I have begun to refer to
as a "dumb store". A dumb store is any store
that you walk into and you imediately feel
that an $18 pair of blue squiggly candles
would not be out of place. They are owned
and operated almost in entirely by milenials
who when they were 23 had "I mustache you
a question" tattoos on their fingers.
I do love these stores. I got a butter 
holder and a new wine opener.

We walked around doing nothing, went to the same
restaurant twice since nothing was open,
and watched Silver Linings Playbook.
It was an incredible weekend.
