I now understand Thomas
there isnt really a good word for a compulsive doubter

The feeling of being caught seven feet under water not sure which way is up
The feeling of being caught in a monday night open mic not sure if the speaker has actually felt hungry,
       feeling not sure if you have actually felt hungry

"My body is a garden!"
"My body is a temple!"
My body is a hand grenade

They should really tell kids most cliches are there for a reason
