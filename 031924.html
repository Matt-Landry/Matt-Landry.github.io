Note from my calendar this fall that turned into a demo,<br>
brought on because I spent the summer thinking of the Elie Wiesel quote<br><br>
<br>"The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. <br>
The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. <br>
The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. <br>
And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference" <br>
